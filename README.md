Welcome to the Github page of ApexGT.

ApexGT is a racing game made in python.

Currently ApexGT is bieng developed with ursina (made by pokepetter)
but i am developing my own engine, that will be faster and easier.

The game is still very in its early pre-alpha state, so dont expect a release anytime soon.
