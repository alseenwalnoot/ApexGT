Welcome to the Github page of ApexGT.

ApexGT is a racing game made in python.

Currently ApexGT is bieng developed with Ursina (made by pokepetter)
but i am developing my own engine, that will be faster and easier.

The game is still very in its early pre-alpha state, so dont expect a release anytime soon.

The game now uses [WalLib](https://github.com/alseenwalnoot/WalLib/tree/main) as its main library for fast code calls

UPDATE 11/1/2024

Currently added feature's:
- Gears and speed for automatic racing
- Main and pause menu's have been improved by creating them in a library therefore making the code faster
- MapLoader V0.8

-~Ursina Networking module for multiplayer (Currently LAN only)~ It is more then completely broken currently
- Save/load game's

Feature's being worked on:
- ModLoader V0.1
- MapLoader V0.9
- All map and car assets
- Server app for multiplayer over the internet


Alpha Release Date: Around FEBRUARI/MARCH
